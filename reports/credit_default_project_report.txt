CREDIT CARD DEFAULT RISK PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Industry Oriented Project Report
Author: Dinesh S

============================================================

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
Financial institutions face significant losses due to customers defaulting on credit card payments. Traditional rule-based systems are often insufficient to accurately identify high-risk customers in advance.

The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning system that can predict whether a customer is likely to default on their next credit card payment using historical financial and behavioral data.

This solution helps banks and financial organizations:
- Reduce financial risk
- Improve loan approval decisions
- Optimize credit limit allocation
- Strengthen risk management strategies

2. DATASET DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset

Dataset Size:
- Records: 30,000 customers
- Features: 23 input features + 1 target variable

Target Variable:
- default payment next month (renamed to target)
    0 = No Default
    1 = Default

Feature Categories:
- Demographic Information:
    LIMIT_BAL, SEX, EDUCATION, MARRIAGE, AGE

- Repayment History:
    PAY_0, PAY_2, PAY_3, PAY_4, PAY_5, PAY_6

- Billing Amounts:
    BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6

- Payment Amounts:
    PAY_AMT1 to PAY_AMT6

- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Stratified train-test split
- Multi-model training and comparison
- Model selection based on ROC-AUC and Recall


============================================================

4. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) INSIGHTS
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Class Distribution:
   - Dataset is imbalanced
   - Majority customers are non-defaulters
   - Business implication: Accuracy alone is misleading

2. Credit Limit Distribution:
   - Most customers fall into lower credit limit ranges
   - Higher credit limits correlate with lower default risk

3. Age vs Default:
   - Default risk varies across age groups
   - Younger and mid-age customers show moderate risk

4. Payment Delay vs Default:
   - Strong positive relationship between payment delay and default
   - Repayment history is the strongest risk indicator

5. Bill Amount vs Default:
   - Defaulters tend to have higher outstanding bills
   - High utilization combined with low payment increases risk

6. Correlation Analysis:
   - PAY_0 to PAY_6 features show strongest correlation with default
   - Billing and payment behavior strongly influence risk outcome


============================================================

5. MODEL PERFORMANCE
------------------------------------------------------------

Five models were trained and evaluated:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. XGBoost

Evaluation Metrics Used:
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- ROC-AUC Score
- Recall (for default class)

A confusion matrix was generated for the final tuned Random Forest model to analyze prediction errors in detail.

Interpretation:

- True Positives (TP): Customers correctly identified as defaulters.
- True Negatives (TN): Customers correctly identified as non-defaulters.
- False Positives (FP): Safe customers wrongly classified as risky.
- False Negatives (FN): Defaulters wrongly classified as safe.

Impact:

False Negatives are the most critical error in credit risk systems because they represent customers who will default but were approved by the system, leading to direct financial loss.

Therefore, the model selection prioritized Recall and ROC-AUC to minimize false negatives rather than relying only on accuracy.

Conclusion:

The confusion matrix confirms that the final model maintains a reasonable balance between detecting risky customers and avoiding unnecessary rejection of safe customers.

Results Summary:

Logistic Regression:
    ROC-AUC ≈ 0.71
    Recall ≈ 0.62

Decision Tree:
    ROC-AUC ≈ 0.61
    Recall ≈ 0.38

Random Forest:
    ROC-AUC ≈ 0.75
    Recall ≈ 0.34

SVM:
    ROC-AUC ≈ 0.75
    Recall ≈ 0.56

XGBoost:
    ROC-AUC ≈ 0.75
    Recall ≈ 0.57

Tuned Random Forest (Final Model):
    ROC-AUC ≈ 0.77
    Recall ≈ 0.57

Final Model Selected:
    Tuned Random Forest Classifier


============================================================

6. FINAL INSIGHTS
------------------------------------------------------------

- Repayment history is the most important predictor of default.
- Customers with frequent payment delays and high bill amounts are significantly riskier.
- Class imbalance must be handled carefully in financial datasets.
- Recall is more critical than accuracy for identifying risky customers.
- Ensemble models outperform single models for complex financial behavior.


============================================================

7. BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Use ML-based risk scoring before approving credit limits.
2. Reduce limits or increase monitoring for customers with repeated payment delays.
3. Offer early intervention programs for medium-risk customers.
4. Continuously retrain model using new transaction data.


============================================================

8. CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be applied to solve real-world credit risk problems in the finance sector.

By integrating data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, multi-model evaluation, and web-based deployment, the system provides an end-to-end industry-ready solution.

Future enhancements include model explainability, live data integration, and automated retraining pipelines.
